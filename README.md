# Data Structures and Algorithms Answers

Broken down by:
* Leetcode
* HackerRack
* Level of Difficulty

Testing is also included for most solutions:
* The test.js files will match up to the solution file names
    * For example, maxSubArray.js corresponds to maxSubArray.test.js
    * Rarely, but sometimes, a file name (e.g. detectCycleIterative.js) will not have a matching test.js file

Two great solutions to look at:
* maxSubArray.js and maxSubArray.test.js - Medium Difficulty Leetcode Solution
* detectCycleIterative.js - Medium Difficulty Leetcode Solution
