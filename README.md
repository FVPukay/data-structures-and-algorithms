# Data Structures and Algorithms Answers

Broken down by:
* Leetcode
* HackerRack
* Level of Difficulty

Testing, [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), is also included for most solutions:
* The test.js files will match up to the solution file names
    * For example, [maxSubArray.js](https://github.com/FVPukay/data-structures-and-algorithms/blob/main/Leetcode/medium/maxSubArray.js) corresponds to [maxSubArray.test.js](https://github.com/FVPukay/data-structures-and-algorithms/blob/main/maxSubArray.test.js)
    * Rarely, but sometimes, a file name (e.g. [detectCycleIterative.js](https://github.com/FVPukay/data-structures-and-algorithms/blob/main/Leetcode/medium/detectCycleIterative.js)) will not have a matching test.js file

Two great solutions to look at:
* [maxSubArray.js](https://github.com/FVPukay/data-structures-and-algorithms/blob/main/Leetcode/medium/maxSubArray.js) and [maxSubArray.test.js](https://github.com/FVPukay/data-structures-and-algorithms/blob/main/maxSubArray.test.js) - Medium Difficulty Leetcode Solution
* [detectCycleIterative.js](https://github.com/FVPukay/data-structures-and-algorithms/blob/main/Leetcode/medium/detectCycleIterative.js) - Medium Difficulty Leetcode Solution
